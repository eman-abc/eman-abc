Hi, I'm Eman Chaudhary
Software Engineering Student @ NUST SEECS
Focus: Deep Learning | NLP | Edge AI

**About Me**
Passionate about deep learning, natural language processing, and edge AI.
Experienced with CNNs, Transformers, LLMs, and deployment on Jetson Nano/Xavier.
Currently working on my FYP: a generative AI system for text-to-face synthesis.
Contributor to NASA OSDR AI/ML Working Groups in space health and biology research.

**Experience**
NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) – AI/ML Analysis Working Group (Jul 2025 – Present)
  > Member of Causal Inference and DNA Damage Imaging subgroups.
  > Exploring causal representation learning and agentic AI for autonomous reasoning on spaceflight datasets.
  > Applying deep learning to high-resolution microscopy for radiation-induced DNA damage classification.

SINES – EmbedAIoT Lab (Jun 2025 – Aug 2025)
  > Designed lightweight CNN and CNN-Transformer architectures for 5G mmWave channel estimation.
  > Applied quantization and pruning for Jetson Nano/Xavier edge deployment.
  > Benchmarked models against SOTA baselines like HELENA.

Apna-Wifi, NUST NSTP (Jun 2024 – Aug 2024)
  > Built Python-based web scrapers with MySQL integration
